Key Insights
Sales Trend:
The analysis reveals a gradual upward trend in monthly sales over the period from 2014 to 2017.
Notable peaks in sales are observed during the holiday season (November and December), indicating that these months consistently experience stronger sales.

Seasonality:

This indicates that promotional campaigns, festive buying behavior, and holidays drive the sales increase during this period.

Anomalies:

This could point to a seasonal slowdown or other external factors such as operational changes, market conditions, or consumer behavior shifts.

The dataset used for the analysis was sourced from Kaggle - Superstore Dataset.
Various visualizations, including line plots, seasonality maps, and animated plots, were created to illustrate sales trends and anomalies.

Conclusion
The Superstore dataset analysis reveals consistent seasonal sales behavior, with significant peaks during the holiday season and a mid-year sales dip.
Understanding these patterns can help in making data-driven decisions regarding inventory management, promotions, and marketing strategies to optimize sales performance.
